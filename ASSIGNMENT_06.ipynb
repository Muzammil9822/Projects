Climate policies are designed to address the threat of climate change, which is caused by human activities that release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat, causing the planet to warm. Climate change is already having a significant impact on the planet, and is expected to cause more extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and changes in plant and animal life.
